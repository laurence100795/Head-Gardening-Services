                <p class="AboutSubContext">I'm the founder and owner of Head Gardening Services. I've been in the business of gardening and landscaping since 2014 and since then it’s become my passion. I've been working in this industry from the age of 16. I started as a labourer
                    part time at the bottom of the food chain and moved up the ranks until I was managing and running projects. I realised at that point I could do it myself, and that's when HGS was born.</p>
                <h2 class="AboutSubHeader">Birth of HGS</h2>
                <p class="AboutSubContext">I started the business in May 2019 and since then my passion has only grown. I provide my services to my clients on a personal level, making sure their every need for their property is fulfilled. I'll take on any task creating and crafting
                    all the needs and wants of my clients. I'm always happy and excited to work with a new client on a challenging new project, making sure they get everything they ask for, and are comfortable to come to me with changes they would like
                    done during the project.</p>
                <h2 class="AboutSubHeader">My History </h2>
                <p class="AboutSubContext">I went to Edgbarrow Secondary School and moved from there to Merrist Wood College where I studied horticulture achieving a Level 2 NVQ in the subject. I graduated from Merrist Wood and got an apprenticeship with Business that specialised
                    in Gardening Services. This is where I learnt the ropes on how to manage my time around customers supplying everything they wanted, and at the same time, providing great customer service. I was with that company for 2 and a half years
                    moving from being an apprentice to managing sites without supervision. I enjoyed my time with that business but I wanted to supply my services to customers my way, so I moved onto HGS.</p>
                <h2 class="AboutSubHeader">My promise</h2>
                <p class="AboutSubContext">If you would like to work with HGS, please get in contact. I promise to supply outstanding service that caters to your every need, within a timely fashion and to the very best standard. My aim is to leave clients feeling proud of what
                    we've achieved together and excited about what we can further achieve into the future.
                </p>
                <p class="AboutSubContext AboutPromise">At HGS, we aim to achieve planting tomorrow's dreams for you.</p>
