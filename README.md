<h1>Mile Stone Project 1</h1>
<p>I am creating a website for a new local business called Head Garden Services. I have known the owner for quite some time and he wants an online presence for his business so we discussed and decided that it would be in both of our interests for me to design a website for him. For this website we decided to keep to only 4 pages which are a Home Page, Services Page, About Me Page and a Contact Me Page. In the below I’ll discuss want I went through to complete these pages.</p>

<h2>Navigation Bar</h2>
<p>The Navigation Bar took a lot of time to complete. I made a couple of different versions and I decided the make it as two parts the top holding the logo and client contact number and, the bottom part containing the links to the various different pages. In the mobile version the bottom element turns into an interactive dropdown including the links. The top part the logo and number go from the left and right to the centre logo on top and number on the bottom. The mobile number is interactive so when you’re on mobile it takes you straight to the dial menu on your phone.</p>

<h2>Footer Bar</h2>
<p>For the footer I kept it very simple by making to divs the same size first stating this is property of the company and second stating me as the creator of this website. I had a lot of trouble getting the footer to stick to the bottom of the page. I didn’t want it fixed to the bottom permanently nor be without one so I researched ways on how to do this. I used the flex tools and it managed to stay at the bottom of the page. If you look at the bottom of this brief you’ll find an accredited link to that code. We were going to add more to the footer such as social media links but he only has Facebook at this time so we left it and might come back to me in the future to add this feature.</p>

<h2>Home Page</h2>
<p>We spoke about the home page for quite some time as this the first page that you see when the website loads. He wanted a simple page with some services, quotes and this catchphrase. At the top a few sentences to try and draw people to look into the website including the catch phrase as the last sentence. I used a photo I found off a copyright free website you’ll find the link to it in the accredited section at the bottom of the page. The second part is 4 of my clients’ most popular services with a button that send the potential customers to the services page. Below that there’s some reviews I took from his Facebook page, when it is on a website/tablet it will display 3 and on mobile it will only display 2. I used bootstrap third width and when below 767px it turns to full width that stack on top of each other.</p>

<h2>About Page</h2>
<p>For the about me page he just wanted to have a brief description on who he is, his work history and some information on his business. I used the bootstrap grid system a standard container so I could have another background image which you’ll find linked in the accredited section (I used the same image on the Contact and Services Page also). For the portrait picture of my client I used the float style to stick it to the top right of the container. When it’s on mobile it’s centred and width 100%, height auto combination to keep the image the correct proportions as well as stay within the container.</p>

<h2>Services Page</h2>
<p>For this page he wanted a brief description on the services he provides as well as an images of his work which he provided to me. I used the bootstrap grid system having the text box 75% width of the container and the image is in a div taking up the remaining 25%. The images are also Bootstrap Modals so when clicked on they appear in the middle of the page with a lime green border and a floating white cross just below the modal. I decided to get a little creative with this page, to start I have made each of services go from left to right down the page with the text sticking to the pattern of the page. The left divs are lime green and the right are grey with the text being the opposite colour for contrast as well as making it easy to read. For the titles of each section, the text is the same colour as the div but it has its own background colour which is the opposite colour so that is stands out and contrasts. The client wanted the names of the services to stand out more on the page so I thought I’d keep to the theme of the page by looping the contrast which I believe gives it a nice style. When it is on a mobile the images drop below the text and images take 100% width of the container with it going title, text and then image. I realised the modal caused some problems on the page when on mobile so I hid the modals for mobile and placed new divs to appear which were just the images with no interaction. The text also loses its left to right pattern on the page and it all gets centred which gives it a cleaner look. The divs containing the text are slightly opaque so you can see the background image threw the elements to give it a nice motional effect.</p>

<h2>Contact-Page</h2>
<p>For this page he wanted it to be simplistic and informative so I kept it to short sentences with links to all of his forms of communication. I started with a catchy sentence to draw in the customers in and straight below put his most used forms of contact, at the top it is Facebook and stated that this is his number 1 way of communication. Then had his email address which is another form of contact and finally is business number that when clicked on mobile it takes to the dial screen on the phone. At the bottom I thought it would be a nice feature to add his availability times so, I used a bootstrap graph and kept it simple with two rows and eight columns. The top row had the titles stating what the sections are and below them are days and times of availability. I kept the theme of this page with the others and used a container with the same background image. I didn’t want to break the colour theme of the website so instead of having a blue Facebook logo I kept it the same lime green but when you hover over it, it turns to Facebook blue. When you click on the Facebook logo it opens a new tab and puts you on his Facebook page in a new tab. For the contact number when you hover over it, it goes from white to lime green to alert the user it is interactive. When it goes to mobile it keeps the same page layout but it text shrinks so everything fits on the page. I used the same spacers that were used on the whisky page tutorial which gave the contact information a nice spacing and breaks it all up into its own sections. </p>

<h2>Styles</h2>
<p>I was provided with the logo of the company from the start and I decided to use the colours of the logo throughout the website as its colour theme. The light and dark green I got from the logo by extracting the colours. I decided to use grey as it worked well with the colours and used different shades of grey to separate the sections at some points on the website. I also used the dark green as borders to add that additional separation of sections. I used three different fonts which were Exo which was used previously on one of the tutorial projects. Livvic which I found and looked like a neat smooth text style. They were the dominant text styles that I used throughout the website, I used one over for the Quotes which was Kalam. I used this one only for the quotes as it resembles handwriting and I thought it would have a nice personal touch for the quotes as if reviewers wrote them on the website. For the backgrounds since they were originally really bright I used opaque overlays with a z-index of -1 so it didn’t affect the other resources on the website but darkened the background as the website’s theme is rather dark.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Overall I am happy with the final product, for my first website which I had multiple struggles with and persevered through I believe it came out really well. The page I’m the happiest with is the contact page it is the simplest page but I think it is the cleanest, not too much but not too little with enough information to get the point across. I tested various different layouts, colours, fonts, elements and it I think it’s come out looking professional and smart. The chrome developer tools I have learnt are a God send, every time I logged into AWS I opened a web version of the website with the developer tools and it helped me get the padding, margins, sizing and various other variables right quickly. I have now got my own way of working with HTML and CSS threw trial and error which still needs working on but works for me. I found this to be the hardest challenge so far but the biggest learning curve so far on the course. I have learnt so much from going and doing it by myself from researching it online, going back threw previous tutorials and experimenting with different styles. </p>
