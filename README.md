Mile Stone Project 1

I am creating a website for a local company called Head Garden Services. I know the owner and he wants an online presence so I decided to create this for him.

This will be a live website used to promote his company to drive work to his business.
I am planning on creating 4 pages for this website:

Home-Page
On this page I'm planning on keeping it simple. minimum text but provides I lot of infomation an image in the background of some work he's done.

About-Page
On this page I'm planning on keeping putting some information about Eden the owner of the business such as how long he's been in the industry his dreams for the company and work history.

Services-Page
On this page I'm going to display the services he provides. I want to have the infomation in blocks which start top left then go down a bit then right and left again until all services are covered.

Contact-Page
On this page I'm going to implement a little information and a statement from Eden regarding this and then link his contact information, such as email, facebook and instagram so people that are interested in his services
they can get in contract with him.



I used this to stop the button on the home page for the code to pass on HTML Validator - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2906582/how-to-create-an-html-button-that-acts-like-a-link -
I used this for all the background images on the pages - https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/ - 
I had a real problem getting the footer stick to the bottom of the page but a found this trip. I used technique 4 - https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/ -
