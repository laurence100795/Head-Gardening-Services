Livvic which I found and looked like a neat smooth text style. They were the dominant text styles that I used throughout the website, I used one over for the Quotes which was Kalam. I used this one only for the quotes as it resembles handwriting and I thought it would have a nice personal touch for the quotes as if reviewers wrote them on the website. For the backgrounds since they were originally really bright I used opaque overlays with a z-index of -1 so it didn’t affect the other resources on the website but darkened the background as the website’s theme is rather dark."]}],[{"start":{"row":22,"column":0},"end":{"row":23,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":313},{"start":{"row":23,"column":0},"end":{"row":24,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""]}],[{"start":{"row":23,"column":0},"end":{"row":23,"column":1},"action":"insert","lines":["<"],"id":314},{"start":{"row":23,"column":1},"end":{"row":23,"column":2},"action":"insert","lines":["h"]},{"start":{"row":23,"column":2},"end":{"row":23,"column":3},"action":"insert","lines":["2"]}],[{"start":{"row":23,"column":3},"end":{"row":23,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":[">"],"id":315},{"start":{"row":23,"column":4},"end":{"row":23,"column":5},"action":"insert","lines":["<"]},{"start":{"row":23,"column":5},"end":{"row":23,"column":6},"action":"insert","lines":["/"]}],[{"start":{"row":23,"column":6},"end":{"row":23,"column":7},"action":"insert","lines":["h"],"id":316},{"start":{"row":23,"column":7},"end":{"row":23,"column":8},"action":"insert","lines":["2"]},{"start":{"row":23,"column":8},"end":{"row":23,"column":9},"action":"insert","lines":[">"]}],[{"start":{"row":23,"column":9},"end":{"row":24,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":317},{"start":{"row":24,"column":0},"end":{"row":24,"column":1},"action":"insert","lines":["<"]}],[{"start":{"row":24,"column":1},"end":{"row":24,"column":2},"action":"insert","lines":["p"],"id":318},{"start":{"row":24,"column":2},"end":{"row":24,"column":3},"action":"insert","lines":[">"]}],[{"start":{"row":24,"column":3},"end":{"row":24,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":["<"],"id":319},{"start":{"row":24,"column":4},"end":{"row":24,"column":5},"action":"insert","lines":["/"]},{"start":{"row":24,"column":5},"end":{"row":24,"column":6},"action":"insert","lines":["p"]},{"start":{"row":24,"column":6},"end":{"row":24,"column":7},"action":"insert","lines":[">"]}],[{"start":{"row":23,"column":4},"end":{"row":23,"column":22},"action":"insert","lines":["Client Involvement"],"id":320}],[{"start":{"row":24,"column":3},"end":{"row":24,"column":2681},"action":"insert","lines":["The client played a big part in the design of the website from how much text he wanted on paged to the images used and colour combinations. We didn’t use a wireframe tool for this project but we used PowerPoint. We put squares on a page with a name on it of what they represented, so we got a good idea of the design he wanted. We did this for the home page and the about me page, the other two he stated what he wanted on the pages but let me design the layout. From that we went through Google Fonts to find some fonts he liked, I recommended Exo which he liked so we used it and came across Livvic which he wanted to use on the website so we did. When he went on about the layout of the home page and he said he wanted me to move some of the reviews from his Facebook page to the site I came up with the idea of finding a third font. We looked for a font that resembles hand writing which was Kalam and we went with it. The colour scheme when we started didn’t sound too visually pleasing. He wanted it to be very bright with a lot of colours and really in your face but I stated it wouldn’t look professional. I suggested from the start to use grey and the colours of the logo and when we compared the different colours with blocks of colour side by side on PowerPoint which quickly made him change his mind. All the text for the website to an extent was provided. For the about me page he provided me his work history education and ideas on what to put on the page. I then wrote it up on a word document and sent it over to him. Changes he made were removing names of companies he worked with, he saw it as advertisement for his competitors so I changed them to just businesses and companies. Apart from that he was happy with the information and the layout. For the services page he provided what exactly he does in each section with brief points and allowed me to tidy them up. When I finished the descriptions I sent them across, he had no complaints or changes about this. One thing that he was adamant about having all over the website was his catch phrase “Planting tomorrow’s dreams”. He originally wanted it on every single page but I stated that would be overkill so we agreed to have it on the home page where it fitted nicely and the last sentence of his about me page (It’s also under the logo so technically it is on every page). For the services page he provide me with images for all the sections which he wanted to be used. The images he provided weren’t the best quality as they were taken off his mobile but insisted that the site uses them and is going to be taking a camera on jobs now to get better pictures so later down the line they can be amended.

Overall he was happy with how all the pages came out and trusted my judgement with design ideas. One page he wanted changing around was his contact me page it, he wanted the links to be in a certain order so I reordered them to Facebook, Email and then Telephone number. When I finished the project I emailed him the deployed link on GitHub so he could go through it. We was very happy with how it all interacted on mobile, he stated “it’s simple to navigate just like I wanted it” I even showed him that the logo was a homepage link which he loved and never realised until now is quite common on websites. I was very critical of my work and every time I finished a page I stress tested it using various devices making sure the proportions worked. I also used the chrome developer tools installing almost every device as well as some wacky designs of my own to try and break the page so I could fix it pre deployment. I spent a good couple of hours when I finished the project making sure that everything worked as intended as well as got family members and friends to go onto it and let me know what they thought and if it looked correct. There were a couple of spacing issues with the home page which I changed but apart from that everything seemed to flow well. Overall all the testers that tried out my website stated there user experience was brilliant.

After messing up the homepage multiple times at the beginning because, I implemented some content then styling and repeated this pattern. I then changed it and started by writing out the page in only html with some styling from bootstrap and then when it was completely fleshed out I then added CSS styling to the pages. Bootstrap is used on every single page. The grid system is what I mainly used as it is so helpful and very powerful. The majority of the divs on this website will have a Bootstrap grid style implemented into them as it assists in consistent page styles as well as great mobile/tablet/desktop compatibility. I did look into over frame works such as Google Materialise and Semantic UI but since I already learnt Bootstrap and this was my first project decided to stick to what I knew. I experimented with different sizing tools such as pixels, percentages and viewport. You’ll find there are different sizing formats for different parts of the website deciding what worked best for which section. Various bootstrap assets I implemented were graphs, interactive buttons, modals, navigation bars and of course the grid system.
